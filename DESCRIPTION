Description: Calculates tide heights based on tide station harmonics.  It
    includes the harmonics data for 637 US stations.  The harmonics data
    was converted from
    <https://github.com/poissonconsulting/rtide/blob/master/data-raw/harmonics-dwf-20151227-free.tar.bz2>,
    NOAA web site data processed by David Flater for 'XTide'.  The code to
    calculate tide heights from the harmonics is based on 'XTide'.
